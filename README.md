## Project Description
- This project is a static website for a general news channel. It provides updates on various topics, including Local, Political, National, International, Sports, and Bollywood news. Additionally, the channel collaborates with an NGO to support the education of underprivileged children through user donations. Visitors to the website can contribute financially to this noble cause if they wish to support the education of needy children.

- The news channel is also partnered with prominent organizations such as BBC, which is highlighted in the site's header.

## Resources Used
In creating this news website, I focused on simplicity and functionality. Here are the resources utilized:
- HTML and CSS: These were the primary technologies used to build and style the website.
- Images: Images were sourced from Google to enhance the visual appeal of the site.
- News Content: News articles were curated from reputable sources, including NEWS24, TIMES NOW, and BBC.

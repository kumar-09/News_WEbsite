            <p class="data">The win means India take the series 3-0 and go top of the ODI world rankings.<br>Captain Rohit scored 101 from 85 balls and Gill a 78-ball 112 as India racked up 385-9 in the 90-run win in Indore.<Br>Opener Devon Conway hit 138 from 100 balls in reply before New Zealand's chase slipped away and the Black Caps were bowled out for 295 in 41.2 overs.<br>Despite losing Finn Allen to the second ball of their innings, the tourists were well placed at 184-2 after 25 overs on a flat pitch.<br>But seamer Shardul Thakur dismissed Daryl Mitchell and Tom Latham in consecutive balls, first Mitchell for 24 and then capta Latham for a first-ball duck, and from there India closed out a comfortable win.<br>
                New Zealand began the series top of the International Cricket Council's ODI rankings but were replaced by England after defeat in the second ODI.<br>India's clean sweep means they now take top spot, nine months out from a World Cup on home soil.<br>
                Gill's century followed his stunning 208 in the first ODI and helped India to their fourth score over 340 this month.</p>

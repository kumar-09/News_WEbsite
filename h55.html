            <p class="data"><b>Anand:</b> Several political leaders on Monday took to their social media platforms to pay tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his birth anniversary. A BJP MLA from Gujarat was also among many who remembered Bose and put up a post on his Facebook page as a tribute to him on his birth anniversary.<br>Yogesh R Patel (Bapji), who represents Anand Assembly constituency in Gujarat, in his post stated Netaji was a member of an “aatankwadi" (terrorist) wing. The MLA, however, later apologised and blamed the incorrect translation for the mistake.<br><br>"Bose was a member of aatankwadi pankh" (wing). He participated in the civil disobedience movement as a Congress leader, and was known for advocating socialist policies,” Patel shared a post in Gujarati on his Facebook page.<br><br>After some people spotted the error, they informed the Anand MLA the about the choice of words.

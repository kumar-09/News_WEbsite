            <h1>Can these players take you to T20 WC final? Ex-PAK captain slams India after 1st NZ T20I with 'Kohli-Rohit' remark</h1>
            <P><i>Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has slammed the Indian team after a crushing defeat in the first T20I against New Zealand. Latif wasn't sure if this team can bring success in T20Is for India while referring to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's absence.</i></P>
            <img src="https://static.tnn.in/photo/msid-97412987,imgsize-1664949,updatedat-1674972275206,width-200,height-200,resizemode-75/97412987.jpg">
            <p class="data">After being on a high of a 3-0 series sweep in the ODIs, the Indian team was brought down to the ground by New Zealand in the first of the three-match T20I series in Ranchi. Hardik Pandya continues to lead a young team in the T20Is and the side was given a reality check as New Zealand outplayed them in all three departments on a surface that turned square, taking the Indian batters by surprise.<br><br>The crushing defeat has invited several extreme reactions from former cricketers and experts but none more than that of ex-Pakistan skipper Rashid Latif. According to Latif, this Indian team doesn't have it in the side to compete in the T20 World Cup for long, while saying that they might not reach the T20 World Cup final next year. </p>

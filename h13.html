            <h1>South Africa to send 12 cheetahs a year to India</h1>
            <P><i>South Africa has signed an agreement to introduce dozens of African cheetahs to India over the next decade.</i></P>

            <p class="data">The first batch of 12 cheetahs will be sent next month, the South African environment department said.<br>It plans to send a similar number annually for the next eight to 10 years to help establish a "viable and secure cheetah population".<br>Asiatic cheetahs became extinct in India in the late 1940s because of excessive hunting and loss of habitat.<br>In 2020 India's Supreme Court ruled that African cheetahs, a different subspecies, could be brought into the country at a "carefully chosen location" on an experimental basis.<br><b>Africa Live: Other stories from across the continent</b><br>
                The selected South African cheetahs have been living in quarantine after their planned translocation last August was delayed while the final details were agreed.<br>"The cheetahs in quarantine... are all still doing well," said Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinary wildlife specialist at the University of Pretoria, who is involved in the project, AFP news agency reported.<br>India received eight cheetahs from Namibia last year and they were released at Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh state.<br>The park, 320km (200 miles) south of New Delhi, is a wildlife sanctuary with abundant prey and grasslands.<br>However, some conservationists argue that the translocation of cheetahs may not be successful as the reserves are close to densely populated villages.</p>

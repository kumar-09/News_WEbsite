            <p class="data">Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo had a memorable debut for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League as his new side won 1-0 against Ettifaq and moved to the top of the table. The Saudi Pro League match between Al Nassr and Ettifaq was one of the most awaited games on the football calendar for more reasons than one, but particularly because it was Ronaldo's debut after the 38-year-old signed a whopping $200 million a year deal with the club for the next 2.5 years following Manchester United ouster.<br><br>Although Ronaldo didn't score a goal, the star forward was busy on the pitch as usual and being the biggest icon for Al Nassr, his every pass and every deception to the opposition was cheered like anything, however, one outstanding piece of skill took the centre stage. The 38-year-old in a clean, crisp and spectacular moment, deceived his marker with a fake shot. Ronaldo seemed to be going for a shot with his right foot, only to pass it back to his left and the defender got wrong-footed and ultimately fell down. The fans couldn't stop praising Ronaldo's skill level in the twilight of his career as the video went viral.

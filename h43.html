            <h1>Hockey World Cup: India crush Asian Games Champion Japan 8-0 in classification match</h1>
            <P><i>Hosts India defeated Asian Cup Champions, Japan, 8-0 in the classification match. â€‹Harmanpreet (46th and 59th minutes) struck twice in the fourth quarter off penalty corners, which should boost his confidence a bit after repeated failures with his drag flick throughout the tournament. He had taken most of India's 26 PCs before Thursday's classification match.</i></P>

            <p class="data">Under-fire captain Harmanpreet Singh finally came good with his drag flick as he and young striker Abhishek struck a brace each as India demolished Asian Games champions Japan 8-0 in an inconsequential FIH Men's World Cup classification match here on Thursday. India, who had made a shock exit from the showpiece event after losing to New Zealand in their crossover match, played their best game but it came too late in the tournament.<br><br>The hosts, who scored four goals each in the third and fourth quarters, will now play South Africa in the ninth to 12th place match on Saturday.</p>
